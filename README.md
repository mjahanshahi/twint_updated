>No authentication. No API. No limits.

Formerly known as Tweep, Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter profiles **without** using Twitter's API.

Twint utilizes Twitter's search operators to let you scrape Tweets from specific users, scrape Tweets relating to certain topics, hashtags & trends, or sort out *sensitive* information from Tweets like e-mail and phone numbers. I find this very useful, and you can get really creative with it too.

Twint also makes special queries to Twitter allowing you to also scrape a Twitter user's followers, Tweets a user has liked, and who they follow **without** any authentication, API, Selenium, or browser emulation. 

## tl;dr Benefits
Some of the benefits of using Twint vs Twitter API:
- Can fetch almost __all__ Tweets (Twitter API limits to last 3200 Tweets only)
- Fast initial setup
- Can be used anonymously and without Twitter sign up
- **No rate limitations**
